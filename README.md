This is a MATLAB script for detecting movement of human eye ball. We have used the Viola Jones algorithm for detecting human face. The hough transform was used to 
detect the eyeball from that individual face. Just run the script with MATLAB and the camera will automatically start to detect the eye ball movement.
All the other comments are provided in the script.
